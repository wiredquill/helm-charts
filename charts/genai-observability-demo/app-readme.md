## Introduction

A set of basic genai applications to showcase Suse Observability's ability to ingest and display LLM open telemetry data generated by OpenLit

## Applications

- Simple: call the open.ai api (ollama’s compliant open.ai api) to generate a joken then turn it into a pirate joke

- Rag101: use standard ollama and melivis api’s for rag. Index a bunch of pds, define tools in prompt, use tools to resolve query.

- Rag102: use langchaiin to index documents into  the melivis vector db, then run queries against them
